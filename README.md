# Proximity Scripts
- **1_dist_time_to_nearest_destination.py:** Use the [BC Route Planner](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=9D99E684CCD042CD88FADC51E079B4B5) to determine distance and drive time from each origin point to the nearest destination point (see figure 1).
- **1_dist_time_to_nearest_destination_with_admin_area.py:** Use the [BC Route Planner](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=9D99E684CCD042CD88FADC51E079B4B5) to determine distance and drive time from each origin point to the nearest destination point AND include an administrative area ID field in the output (see figure 1).
- **1_route_salvager_with_admin_area.py:** Use the [BC Route Planner](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=9D99E684CCD042CD88FADC51E079B4B5) to provide a new random sample of addresses to replace those that were unroutable using the 1_dist_time_to_nearest_destination_with_admin_area.py script. This list of replacement addresses can then be reprocessed by the 1_dist_time_to_nearest_destination_with_admin_area.py script and replace the records containing NULL values in the original output. 
- **2_avg_dist_time_per_destination.py:** Use the [BC Route Planner](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=9D99E684CCD042CD88FADC51E079B4B5) to calculate average distance and drive time for each destination point using all nearest origin points (see figure 2).
- *Sample input arguments included at the top of each script.*
